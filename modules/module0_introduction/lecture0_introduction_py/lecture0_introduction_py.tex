		\underline{\large Lectures and Assignments}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item This programming course is organized into topic based modules. Each module contains a lecture with slides, and a tutorial with instructions and example code.  
			
			\item The lectures will be held in class, and after each lecture we will work on the tutorials as a group. After completing each tutorial you will write a short summary (README) documenting your program and the work you have done.
			
			\item In addition to the tutorials, programming challenges will be assigned throughout the course to test the skills you have acquired. After completing each programming assignment you will write a short report documenting your program and the work you have done.

		\begin{itemize}
			\item You will take a midterm and a final exam in class, and each exam will have a paper and programming component.
			
			\item Your final grade comes from participation in the tutorials (25\%), completion of the programming challenges(25\%), as well as the two graded exams (25\% + 25\%).     
			
			\item See the published syllabus for the complete course details and policies.

			\item Some assignments may be completed as a group, but some must be completed as individuals. Ask the instructor if you are unsure. 
			
			\item {\BL Sharing of code between students or is \underline{not allowed} unless the activity is designated as a group assignment by the instructor. \vspace{2mm} \\ The Tennessee Technological University academic misconduct policy clearly states that all submitted work must be original and authored by the student(s) submitting the assignment.}

					\item {\bf Overview:} In the first tutorial you are going to choose your programming environment on your computer and write your first program, {\it Hello World}.  		

					\item {\bf Assignment:} Complete the tutorial in the document {\it tutorial\MNUM\_introduction\_py.pdf } on ilearn. You must be able to display a custom message from your program to the terminal or standard output.
                    
                    \item {\bf Deliverable:} Write a brief summary of what you accomplished and what you struggled with the most. Include a screen shot or copy of the output of your program.   
    
                    \item {\bf Next Week:} After completion of Module \MNUM, you are ready to learn about Variables, Expressions and Assignment. \vspc
